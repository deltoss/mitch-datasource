# Introduction

When developing multiple data-oriented components, there can be a lot of redundancies when it comes to common data operations such as paging, searching, or sorting. To reduce this redundancy, `mitch-datasource` was developed as flexible package to handle the management of data for components.

# Documentation

The project documentation can be found in the repo's [Netlify site](https://mitch-datasource.netlify.com)

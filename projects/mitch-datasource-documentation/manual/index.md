- Works and tested with React & Vue (See `mitch-datasource-test-vue` & `mitch-datasourve-test-react` projects)
- Pagination
- Sorting (Single & Multi Column Support)
- Search (Single & Multi Column Support)
- Datasources for:
  - AJAX
  - Array
- Highly Customisable & Extensible
- Events

# Requested/Future Improvements

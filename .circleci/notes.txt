::Continuous Deployment::
-------------------------

::NPM & GitHub Release::

Follow tutorial from:
  https://circleci.com/blog/publishing-npm-packages-using-circleci-2-0/

In addition, also utilises the semantic-release package to
automate the process of npm releases via commit messages.
Note you can do an initial easy setup using the
semantic-release-cli tool.

In addition, if you don't want to write commits in the
correct format, you can use the commitizen package
which displays prompts to do so for you.

Note that for the CI/CD script to actually work, it'll
require the below environment variables to be set for
Circle CI. The semantic-release package automatically
utilises these environment variables if set.

- `GH_TOKEN` - an access token for GitHub. Used to create GitHub releases and tag commits with releases.
- `NPM_TOKEN` - an access token for npm registry. Used to deploy package to npm registry.

::Documentation Release::

The HTML documentation is generated by `esdoc`, but for
it to actually be hosted, the `netlify-cli` package is
used to manually deploy to netlify after the build &
tests steps are completed.

Note that for the CI/CD script to actually work, it'll
require the below environment variables to be set for
Circle CI. The Netlify CLI automatically
utilises these environment variables if set.

- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - an access token to use when authenticating commands.
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` - links the repository to an existing created Netlify site.

For more information, see:
- https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#obtain-a-token-in-the-netlify-ui
- https://github.com/netlify/cli/blob/master/docs/commands/deploy.md
- https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#link-with-an-environment-variable

Consider disabling Netlify's default functionality of automatically
deploying when changes gets detected in the GIT repository. The
reasoning is because CircleCI manually manages Netlify deployment
through `Netlify CLI`. This provides more flexibility, and only
deploys to Netlify if the test & build steps succeeds.
